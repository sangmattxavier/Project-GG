# Documentation

*Purpose:* This project aims to create a niche social media for Gamers.

*Platform:* Website (ReactJS), then Mobile (ReactNative)

*Plan:* UX -> UI -> Front End -> Middle End -> Back End -> Deploy

*Discussion Notes:*
* Landing -> Signup -> Tweak -> Home
* Landing -> Login -> Home
* (user still signed in) -> Home
* Banner Ads using Machine Learning
* Incorporate Legendary Yellow, Epic Purple, Rare Blue, Uncommon Green, Common Gray?
* Maybe have a most popular group of the day?
* Every profile has rank from Bronze -> Diamond, use honor system to show credibility of users
* “I just had an idea but it might be straying from the original idea, but what if we added "classes" or "skills" for people like artists, comedian (probably too much maybe just memes), writer, player, and they'd have their own level/rank. This is more so going into detail for gaining xp for the posts, so like when people post game art, they gain xp in art and a person could be like a level 4 / platinum artist. The idea was to expand the demographic to a creative one like Tumblr has, but more game-focused of course.”
